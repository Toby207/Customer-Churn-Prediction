# Customer-Churn-Prediction
-Initial project objective: Develop a customer churn prediction classifier using a Kaggle dataset with 10,000 samples.

-Approach: Conducted exploratory data analysis through visualizations and implemented machine learning algorithms (SVM, Random Forest, Decision Trees, KNN) for classification.

-Data preprocessing: Included label encoding, one-hot encoding, standardization of features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

-Model evaluation: Calculated accuracy scores for each model to assess performance, with Random Forest achieving the highest accuracy of 86.74%.

-Conclusion: Provided insights and predictive models to aid businesses in effectively mitigating customer churn and fostering long-term customer satisfaction and growth.
